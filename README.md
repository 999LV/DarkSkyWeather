# DarkSkyWeather
DarkSky Weather plugin for Vera UI7 and openLuup.

This plugin gets weather and forcast data from https://darksky.net.

After installation via the MiOS or ALTUI App store you must get a API key at http://darksky.net/dev. 
Normally the plugin is set to refresh 48 times per day, so well under the free threshold.

More documentation will be avaible in the wiki at a later date.

Thanks to logread for the initial development.
